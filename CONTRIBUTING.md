# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the xevrac_docs. Though the guidelines set below aren't strict, failing to comply to them might result in rejection of your contribution, please take care in reading them.

## How to contribute

### Reporting documentation issues

Before reporting an issue, please make sure that it has not already been reported by another contributor by searching through the [open issues](https://github.com/Xevrac/docs/issues) list and that it is relevant to the current version found here, [https://docs.xevrac.com](https://docs.xevrac.com).

Once you are certain that your issue is unique and relevant you can report it by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/Xevrac/docs/issues/new) and describing it in detail. Please make sure you use **clear details** within your title, notes and/or comments, as this will make it easier to resolve.

After you've submitted your issue it will be completed in time once it's been looked at, so please have patience.
