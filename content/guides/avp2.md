### First time setup:

When launching the game for the first time you may want to set your resolution to something more adapted to a modern screen resolution.

Once in the game you will want to further tweak the graphics settings and adjust your game resolution to match your native resolution in the options menu. Note that the menus and HUD do not scale on higher resolutions, you may find playing on anything larger that 1920x1080 will make everything too difficult to read.

In options menu, go to network and set your network speed to T3, this will ensure you receive maximum packets from the game server in a given period of time. It's generally recommended to leave at T3 however you can tweak this on servers with high ping/latency.

---

### Joining a multiplayer match:

Now that everything is set up you can launch the game and go to the Multiplayer Internet, then Find games. 

Wait for the list to refresh and then look for our server called `Xevnet.AVP2 - AUS - https://xevnet.au` or look for others if you desire.

Before joining a server you can click the Player tab you can set your in-game name and change your character / class.
Pay attention to the class weapons / abilities that each character has. You can change your character / class in game with F1 if you change your mind later.

---

### Troubleshooting:

There is a known issue on some GPUs where the Z-Buffer wigs out and everything is see-through. Disable Triple Buffering from graphics settings menu in the game and restart the game to fix this. 

You can quickly check if your game is experiencing this issue by looking at the character portraits in the single player screen, if they are rendering weird and the background is popping in front of them, you've got this issue.

### Pro-Tips:

<b>Human</b>

  Humans have two teams, Marines and Corporate mercenaries - they hate each other

  Humans can pick up armour scattered around the map

  Humans have ammo boxes scattered around the map

  EMP grenades stun enemies and de-cloak predators

  Predators that are set on fire with the flamethrower are easier to see

  Humans may find exo-suits on the map if enabled by the server they have two weapon modes (scroll wheel to change)
  - Flamethrower and laser gun on one arm
  - Dual mini-gun and rocket launcher on the other arm

  Use your knife to cut out of a predator net

  Your radar only detects motion

<b>Alien</b>

  The Alien Praetorian class is a bit of a "tank" but cannot pounce or wall walk, weak to AP rounds

  The same for an Alien Queen

  Aliens pounce ability makes them highly mobile, able to traverse the map quickly or escape bad situations

  Avoid running head on into gun/plasma fire, use wall walking, pouncing and jumping to create disorienting movement patterns

  Alien pounce and tail attack stuns enemies

  Aliens heal by mutilating corpses

  Aliens can "head-bite" using primary fire while looking at an enemies head - rewards extra health but is a slower attack

  Aliens can morph into a Queen after achieving a kill-streak set by the server

  Queens are the only alien that can do big damage with their tail

  Aliens hate fire

  Claws break predator nets

<b>Predator</b>

Predators have ammo boxes scattered around the map

Cloaked predators are partially visible while moving

Water de-cloaks predators

Plasma weapons and disc de-cloak predator when fired

Cloak drains energy over time

Homing weapons (Disc and plasma caster) emit visible laser from predator helmet

switching vision modes makes cloaked predators eyes visible for a moment

If you miss with your disc, press f and the disc will home back towards you, you may be able to get your target in the back

You can also create traps with your disc by embedding it into a wall and pressing f to retrieve it when an enemy runs by (retrieving a disc does not de-cloak)

If line of sight between the disc and a predator is broken, the disc will teleport back to the predator at an increased energy cost

The spear gun is a projectile based sniping weapon,  good for headshots if you can line up your targets well

Cloaking is useless against aliens

### Key callouts when playing AVP2 Community Servers:

It is considered bad mannered to use plasma weapons for cheap kills

It's also bad mannered to pounce spam for cheap kills

Don't use auto-targeting weapons as a human

Abusing the above will probably get you kicked
