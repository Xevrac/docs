### Installing Zandronum:

<b>i.</b> Download Zandronum from the hyperlink in [prerequisites](/guides/doom/#prerequisites), choose the download corresponding to your Operating System.

<b>ii.</b> Run the installer, or if you downloaded the archive, unzip it to your desired location. 

<b>iii.</b> Locate the installed files and if you haven't already, create a shortcut of the `zandronum.exe` to your desktop.

<b>iv.</b> From the `Zandronum` folder, open `Doomseeker` folder and create a shortcut of `doomseeker.exe` to your desktop.

<b>v.</b> Run Zandronum and complete the first time setup, you will be asked to locate your `IWAD` files. 

<b>vi.</b> Once you're in-game adjust your Settings, Controls, Graphics as desired. We recommend using HQ texture filtering to improve harsh low-textures on larger screen resolutions. - <i>More information [Zandronum Wiki - Configuring Zandronum](https://wiki.zandronum.com/Configuring_Zandronum)</i>

<b>vii.</b> Close Zandronum and proceed to [Doomseeker](/guides/doom/#doomseeker).

---

### Doomseeker:

> Note: Depending on your Operating System, Doomseeker may not come bundled with Zandronum and needs separate installation - see [prerequisites](/guides/doom/#prerequisites).

<b>i.</b> Open `Doomseeker`, this is the multiplayer client for Zandronum. On initial launch it will recommend Configuration. Open Doomseeker's settings and configure the client. In short, you will need to point Doomseeker to Zandronum as the game-client. This is referred to as `'engine'` and `'path to executable'`.

<b>ii.</b> Once you have configured the client and return to the server list screen you should see a list of servers. If something is wrong you can read more on configuring Doomseeker via [Zandronum Wiki - Configuring Doomseeker](https://wiki.zandronum.com/Install_Doomseeker).

<b>iii.</b> Locate one of our servers in the server list. We recommend using the filter to refine results, once the client has fetched a list of servers look for server names like `[AUS] xevnet - {gamemode} - https://xevnet.au`.

<b>iv.</b> Double-click our server to join - A WAD Seeker box will appear and automatically download the required [PWAD](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/PWAD) or [PK3](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/PK3) files to join. (These are add-ons and mods for the game)
  - <i>Note: You can manually download our `PWAD` & `PK3` files if desired or if WAD Seeker is down via [our repository](https://doom.xevnet.au/wads/).</i>

<b>v.</b> Once WAD Seeker has fetched the files you require (<i>or you have downloaded and manually defined</i>) your game will start using the configuration settings you set in Zandronum earlier. Congrats! Happy fragging!
